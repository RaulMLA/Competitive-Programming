# üèÜ Competitive Programming
Welcome to my Competitive Programming repository!

Competitive Programming involves honing problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and efficient coding techniques. Online platforms such as Codeforces, LeetCode, and HackerRank offer a wide range of problems to practice and compete against other programmers.

## üìå Disclaimer
In this repository, you will find my solutions to various programming problems from different online platforms and competitions. It's important to note that these solutions may not always be the most optimized or elegant approaches as they were implemented quickly, often under time pressure, to simulate real competition situations. However, they serve as a reflection of my current skills and the thought process used during the contests. As I continue to grow and gain new skills in competitive programming, I aim to implement solutions in a more efficient and elegant manner. Stay tuned for further improvements and updates!

## üìå Multiple Programming Languages
As I explore different programming languages, I strive to provide solutions in multiple languages within this repository. This allows me to experiment and showcase how various languages can be used to solve the same problem. You will find solutions implemented in languages such as Python, C or C++, but my objective is to add more languages in the future as I dive deeper into competitive programming.

## üìå Contribution
While I am currently the sole contributor to this repository, I welcome suggestions, improvements, and discussions related to the provided solutions. I appreciate collaborative efforts and learning from others in the programming community. For the moment, I am not accepting solutions for new problems, but I am open to suggestions for improvements to existing solutions.
